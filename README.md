# 🛡️ Aegis Sentinel

> **Protect. Detect. Respond. Autonomously.**

An AI-powered **Cloud Incident Detection & Response (CIDR)** platform that continuously monitors cloud infrastructure, detects behavioral anomalies using Machine Learning, and automatically responds to security incidents through intelligent SOAR playbooks.

Aegis Sentinel is designed to reduce alert fatigue by focusing on **behavior-based detection** instead of traditional signature-based security, enabling security teams to identify sophisticated attacks across modern cloud environments.
